    <p>
      2025 Prom Trends are all about <strong>bold tones</strong>, <strong>elegant slits</strong>, and <strong>modern romance</strong>. Look out for deep reds, emerald greens, and shimmering metallics. Tulle overlays, corset bodices, and off-shoulder sleeves are making waves this season — and don't forget the power of a statement back!
